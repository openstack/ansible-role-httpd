prelude: >
    Implemented a standalone role ``httpd`` for Apache Web Server (HTTPD)
    configuration that aims to be included in various roles that require
    Apache2 (i.e. keystone, horizon, skyline, etc).
features:
  - |
    Created a common ``httpd`` role to unify approach for managing
    Apache2 instalaltion and configuration across roles.
    Role is written in relatively agnostic way and should be suitable
    for usage outside of OpenStack-Ansible deployments as well.
